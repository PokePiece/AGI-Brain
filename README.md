# 🧠 The Brain

AGI Brain App

This is the FastAPI backend for **the Brain**, an AGI Brain app powered by [Together AI](https://platform.together.ai/) using the LLaMA 3 70B model. It handles chat routing, returns model responses, tracks token usage, and supports minimal in-memory conversation context.

## ✨ About the AGI Brain

The AGI Brain represents an advanced artificial general intelligence system, designed to execute complex logical operations simultaneously through robust asynchronous functionality. Engineered primarily in Python, its comprehensive knowledge base is currently managed by ChromaDB, with a strategic transition to Supabase planned for enhanced scalability and dynamic evolution. This architecture features distinct logical partitions, allowing for independent task routing across diverse subjects. The system is structured into three specialized modules: a forward-focused communication segment for human interaction, a powerful core module for intricate reasoning, automation, and integrated tool use, and a dedicated 'suites' module for specialized functions such as coding, research, and skill creation. This design fundamentally optimizes the Brain for rapid advancements in AI reasoning capabilities.

🔒 Security Notes
This backend connects to external AI models and may process sensitive data. Current protections include:

API key stored in .env

Local-only use recommended during development

Future features will include:

JWT-based user auth

Route-level protection

Rate limiting and per-user memory
